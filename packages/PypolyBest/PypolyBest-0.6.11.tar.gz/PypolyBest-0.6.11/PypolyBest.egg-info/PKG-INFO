Description: ##DOCUMENTATION
        
        PypolyBest has a class named polyBest. 
        Constructor of this class accepts four parameters:
            1. Feature Data-frame(a matrix type object)
            2. Target Data-frame(a matrix type object)
            3*. A list of coefficients of regularization for lasso regression of degree 1,2,3,.. 
               in that order upto whatver degree you would like to do polynomial regression.
            4. Train-Test split ratio
            5. boolean value, pass True if u want to do StandardScaler else pass False
        The class has two methods:
            1. mseScore(): takes no parameters, returns a list of mse scores of len(3*).
            2. maescore(): takes no parameters, returns a list of mae scores of len(3*)
