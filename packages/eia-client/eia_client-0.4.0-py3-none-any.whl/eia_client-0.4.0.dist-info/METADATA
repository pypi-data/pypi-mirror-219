# EIA Open Data API Python Client Package

This is an unofficial http client in python for the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Open Data API](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/). It has minimal functionality and is under development. Please use it at your own risk.

The API is vast and the quickest way to get an understanding for the endpoints is to use the [online browser](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/).


## Installation

You can install the package from pypi. It is recommended to install it in a virtual environment.

``` bash

$ pip install eia-client

```

## Example

Below is a quick example showing how to submit a request to the
"total energy monthly" API endpoint for electricity net generation total
endpoint.

``` python

import eia_client as ec

endpoint = ec.endpoint.TotalEnergy(msn="ELETPUS")

client = ec.Client()
resp = client.get(endpoint.build())

df = ec.parse.as_dataframe(resp)
print(df.head())

df.to_csv("eia_data.csv")

```

You can view an extended version of this example and others in `examples/Quickstart_tminTutorial.ipynb`.


## API Key

Go to the [EIA Open Data API site](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/) and create, then downlaod an API key.

The package assumes the API Key for EIA is stored in your home directory as `~/.eia.config` (text) or an environment
variable called EIA_API_KEY.

*WARNING* Don't spam the API, there is nothing in the code to protect you from going over any rate limits; save the data and request as you need.


## Feature pipeline

- Endpoint query functionality to allow the user to discover endpoints.

- Walking endpoints without breaching rate limits.

- Backend adapters.

- Publish sphinx docs.

- Add more endpoints.

- Github workflow.
