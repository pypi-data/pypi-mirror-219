## GigaGAN - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511v2">GigaGAN</a> <a href="https://mingukkang.github.io/GigaGAN/">(project page)</a>, new SOTA GAN out of Adobe.

I will also add a few findings from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lightweight-gan">lightweight gan</a>, for faster convergence (skip layer excitation), better stability (reconstruction auxiliary loss in discriminator), as well as improved results (GLU in generator).

It will also contain the code for the 1k - 4k upsamplers, which I find to be the highlight of this paper.

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">StabilityAI</a> for the sponsorship, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source artificial intelligence.

- <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for their accelerate library

- All the maintainers at <a href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip">OpenClip</a>, for their SOTA open sourced contrastive learning text-image models

## Todo

- [x] make sure it can be trained unconditionally
- [x] read the relevant papers and knock out all 3 auxiliary losses
    - [x] matching aware loss
    - [x] clip loss
    - [x] vision-aided discriminator loss
    - [x] add reconstruction losses on arbitrary stages in the discriminator (lightweight gan)
    - [x] figure out how the random projections are used from projected-gan
    - [x] vision aided discriminator needs to extract N layers from the vision model in CLIP
    - [x] figure out whether to discard CLS token and reshape into image dimensions for convolution, or stick with attention and condition with adaptive layernorm - also turn off vision aided gan in unconditional case
- [x] unet upsampler
    - [x] add adaptive conv
    - [x] modify latter stage of unet to also output rgb residuals, and pass the rgb into discriminator. make discriminator agnostic to rgb being passed in
    - [x] do pixel shuffle upsamples for unet
- [ ] do a review of the auxiliary losses
- [ ] get a code review for the multi-scale inputs and outputs, as the paper was a bit vague
- [ ] add upsampling network architecture
- [ ] port over CLI from lightweight|stylegan2-pytorch
- [ ] hook up laion dataset for text-image
