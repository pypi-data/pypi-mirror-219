**Start** button will, like the name suggest, start the framework.
If the **Load all at start** checkbox inside *Schema definition* tab is checked, it will also load all of the
defined accounts into DAF.

You can tell the framework is running when the buttons change colors:

Additionally you can see the framework reporting successful initialization inside the *Output* tab.
