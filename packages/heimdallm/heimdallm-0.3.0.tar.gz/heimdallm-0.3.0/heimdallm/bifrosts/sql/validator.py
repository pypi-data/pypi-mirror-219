        database. This is used to instruct the LLM how to constrain the query that it
        generates. Only one of these identities needs to match for the query to be
        compliant.

        The reason that we return a sequence, and not a single identity, is that
        sometimes an LLM will specify the constraint as part of a ``JOIN`` condition,
        and not a ``WHERE`` condition. In that case, the column in the JOIN condition
        may not match the column you expect.

        For example, consider selecting films for a customer, constrained by the
        customer id. The LLM may give you a query like this:

        .. code-block:: sql

            SELECT f.title
            FROM film f
            JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id=i.film_id

            JOIN customer c ON r.customer_id=c.customer_id
            WHERE c.customer_id=:customer_id

        Or you may receive a query like this:

        .. code-block:: sql

            SELECT f.title
            FROM film f
            JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id=i.film_id

                ON i.inventory_id=r.inventory_id
                AND r.customer_id=:customer_id

        Both ``rental.customer_id`` and ``customer.customer_id`` are valid requester
        identities, so ou need to specify both of them by returning a
        :class:`heimdallm.bifrosts.sql.common.RequiredConstraint` for each of them.
