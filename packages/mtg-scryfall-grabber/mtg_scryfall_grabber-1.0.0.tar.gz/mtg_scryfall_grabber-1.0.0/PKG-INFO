mtg_scryfall_grabber (MSG) is a Python library and module for scraping and organizing data from the Scryfall Rest-API.

`conda` is not _needed_ but a sample `environment.yaml` is provided for the bare minimums you need to run in your own conda enviornment.

## Installation

Please go to [Releases](https://github.com/Contrastellar/mtg-scryfall-grabber/releases) for the latest directories.

Additionally, this can be installed from pip using

```bash
python3 -m pip install mtg_scryfall_grabber
```


## Usage

After installing via pip using 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade mtg_scryfall_grabber
```

The functions from `mtg_scryfall_grabber.py` can be invoked using
```python
import mtg_scryfall_grabber
```


## Quickstart (/w conda)


### conda install

`conda` can be installed from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html)

### Once conda is installed

1. Clone the following repo
```
https://github.com/Contrastellar/mtg_scryfall_grabber
```

2. Navigate to the repo
```sh
cd ./mtg_scryfall_grabber/
```

3. Install the environment, where `$NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT` is any name, or is omitted altogether, as one is given in the file.
```sh
conda env create --file ./environment.yaml --name $NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT
```

4. Activate the environment
```sh
conda activate $NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT
```

5. Navigate to the `./example/` directory
```sh
cd ./example/
```

6. Run the following OS dependant command to download the information for the set "Phyrexia, All Will Be One"
### PowerShell
```bash
py msfg.py ONE -c -p
```

### Unix 
```bash
python3 msfg.py ONE -c -p
```


## Quickstart w/o conda
To get started quickly, one must install Python 3 (version 3.8 or greater).

Once having completed Python 3 installation for your Operating System, running the following command

### PowerShell ---
```bash
py -m pip install --upgrade mtg-scryfall-grabber
```

### MacOS/UNIX Terminal/bash ---
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade mtg-scryfall-grabber
```

This will install mtg-scryfall-grabber's `mtg_scryfall_grabber` library, to be imported and used in your own Python Module if so desired.
From here, downloading (either from releases, or from [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository) the `example/msfg.py` file. Once this is done, the following steps can be taken to 'quickstart' downloading information from the Scryfall API.

1. In your commandline (henceforth the CLI), navigate to the directory.
```bash
cd $MTG_SCRYFALL_GRABBER_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION/example/
```

2. Run the following command to download the information for the set "Phyrexia, All Will Be One"
### PowerShell
```bash
py msfg.py ONE -c -p
```

### MacOS/UNIX Terminal/Bash
```bash
python3 msfg.py ONE -c -p
```

In `./example/`, this will create a directory named "output", which will contain a `.json` file named like `ONE_name_price_$(TIME).json` -- where it is compiled by set code + unix time.


## TODO

Nothing else major needs to be done at this point, however polishing and code testing will be implemented to this library before this is considered a full, ready-to-be-used in production v.1 release.

Additional functions need to be implimented, however -- an example implementation of this library is given in `./example/` under `msfg.py`. This implementation can also be treated as the "primary" method of using this library, in order to generate JSON to be used inside Excel spreadsheets or another spreadsheet program.
