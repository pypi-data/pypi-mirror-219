# PhenoBench Development Kit

![](https://www.phenobench.org/imgs/devkit_teaser.jpg)

[PhenoBench](https://www.phenobench.org) is a large dataset and benchmarks for the semantic interpretation of images of real agricultural fields. Together with the dataset, we provide a development kit that provides:

- a framework-agnostic data loader.
- visualization functions for drawing our data format.
- evaluation scripts, `phenobench-eval`, for all tasks (also used on the CodaLab servers).
- validator, called `phenobench-validator`, checking CodaLab submission files for consistency

For more information on the dataset, please visit [www.phenobench.org](https://www.phenobench.org).

## Getting started

1. [Download](https://www.phenobench.org/dataset.html) the dataset.
2. Install the development kit: `pip install phenobench`.
3. Explore the data with the [tutorial notebook](phenobench_tutorial.ipynb).
4. See the [code of our baselines](https://github.com/phenobench-baselines) as a starting point or train your own models.
5. See the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) for common questions and troubleshooting.

If you discover a problem or have general questions regarding the dataset, don't hesitate to open an issues. We will try to resolve your issue as quickly as possible.

## Evaluation scripts (`phenobench-eval`)

**Important:** Install all dependencies with `pip install "phenobench[eval]"`.

For evaluating and computing the metrics for a specific task, you can run the `phenobench-eval` tool as follows:

```bash
$ phenobench-eval --task <task> --phenobench_dir <dir> --prediction_dir <dir> --split <split>
```
 - `task` is one of the following options: `semantics`, `panoptic`, `leaf_instances`, `plant_detection`, `leaf_detection`, or `hierarchical`.
 - `phenobench_dir` is the root directory of the PhenoBench dataset, where `train`, `val` directories are located.
 - `prediction_dir` is the directory containing the predictions as sub-folders, which depend on the specific tasks.
 - `split` is either `train` or `val`.

Note that **all ablation studies of your approach should run on the validation set**. Thus, we also provide a comparably large validation set to enable a solid comparison of different settings of your approach.

## CodaLab Submission Validator (`phenobench-validator`)

Before you submit a zip file to our CodaLab competitions, see also our available [benchmarks](https://www.phenobench.org/benchmarks.html), you can use the `phenobench-validator` to check your submission for consistency. The tool is also part of the pip package, therefore after installing the package via pip, you can call the `phenobench-validator` as follows:

```bash 
$ phenobench-validator --task <task> --phenobench_dir <dir> --zipfile <zipfile>
```
- `task` is one of the following options: `semantics`, `panoptic`, `leaf_instances`, `plant_detection`, `leaf_detection`, or `hierarchical`.
- `phenobench_dir` is the root directory of the PhenoBench dataset, where `train`, `val` directories are located.
- `zipfile` is the zip file that you want to submit to the corresponding benchmark on CodaLab.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:**  What are the usage restrictions of the PhenoBench dataset?  
**Answer:** We distribute the dataset using the CC-BY-SA International 4.0 license, which allows research but also commercial usage as long as the dataset is properly attributed (via a citation of the corresponding paper) and distributed with the same license if altered or modified. See also our [dataset overview page](https://www.phenobench.org/dataset.html) for the full license text, etc.
