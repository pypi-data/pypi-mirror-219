# CHANGELOG.md

This document will summarize notable changes and work on the project, and it attempt to follow the [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) document format. This means that each release section may contain the following sections:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

This project is currently an empty skeleton of a repository, and any functionality or usefulness is entirely unintentional and completely accidental. It will, however, attempt to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

- A repository with more dev tools than actual source code. There may be something here eventually, but there's not much as of now. 
- You should be able to do the following:

```python
>>> import auldcommons
>>> auldcommons.__version__
'0.0.1'
```
