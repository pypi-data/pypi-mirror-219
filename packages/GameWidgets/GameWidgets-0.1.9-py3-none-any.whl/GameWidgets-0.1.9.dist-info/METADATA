# GameWidgets 0.1.9
______________

Install GameWidgets by writing one of two things:

*Mac*

```pip3 install GameWidgets```
___

*Windows*

```pip install GameWidgets```

# **Updates and patches**
______________
**Patches for the Engine.Entity system are now fixed**
allowing to make certain types of game objects. 
Entities are classes meant to be inherited, not to
be used as a standalone. To add an entity to a 
group, there is a new group section
___
**Update for the Engine.Group**

The group system has a new addition by making a new
class called GroupObj, this class is for objects 
that are not standalone images. Buttons, Inputs,
Entities, etc. 
___
**Patch for Engine.Group**


The old group class is now called GroupImg
and supports simple images.
# Main Update
___

The engine folder is now semi-test and can be used 
somewhat stably for projects; as a side 
note, the Engine folder is a rapidly changing 
folder and so if you choose to update your version 
proceed with the following warning: 
Features and functions available in versions before 
may be deprecated or discontinued, by changing the
version, you choose to use a different version with
therefore different files, functions, and classes.
___
There is a new file called manager that can now 
handle the work of multiple lines in a draw loop,
It requires groups in the Engine.Groups. There 
are separated by things called layers. The higher
the layer, the more priority is given.
