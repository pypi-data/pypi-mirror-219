         Corrector for aberrations in an electron microscope.
         
         Different vendors use a different naming schemes for aberration coefficients.
         It is the users responsibility to map to the best matching values.
         
         In transmission electron microscopes the spherical aberration corrector is
         a component that is controlled via instructing the microscope to achieve
         set point values. The corrector is composed of multiple lenses and other
         parts with vendor-specific details which are often undisclosed.
         
         In the case of Nion Co. microscopes the coefficients of the corrector can be
         retrieved via NionSwift, which is why currently the Nion convention for the
         aberration coefficients is used.
