# fastapi-nextauth-jwt

This project contains a FastAPI dependency that can be used to decrypt and validate JWTs generated by NextAuth.
The purpose of this project is to make it easy to use a FastAPI backend in projects that use Next.js and NextAuth 
in the frontend. 

Besides JWT decryption and validation, NextAuth compatible cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection is also implemented.

# Installation
General usage:
```shell
pip install fastapi-nextauth-jwt
```
Development:
```shell
pip install "fastapi-nextauth-jwt[test]"
```

# Usage

```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi_nextauth_jwt import NextAuthJWT

app = FastAPI()

JWT = NextAuthJWT(
    secret="y0uR_SuP3r_s3cr37_$3cr3t",
)

@app.get("/")
async def return_jwt(jwt: Annotated[dict, Depends(JWT)]):
    return jwt
```

There are a few configuration options available in the NextAuthJWT constructor, but the most important one is `secret`,
which should be equivalent to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` on the Next.js side. 

It is also possible to enable or disable CSRF protection using `csrf_prevention_enabled`. 
If this is not set, this will looks at the ENV environment variable. If this is `dev` then CSRF protection will be disabled.

You should also set the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable, as it is used to determine
whether or not secure cookies are being used. Or you can set the cookie names manually.
