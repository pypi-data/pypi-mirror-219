# simple2encrypt

`simple2encrypt` is a Python library that provides utility functions for encryption and file operations. It includes functionalities for encrypting and decrypting data using the AES algorithm, generating encryption keys, reading and writing binary data from/to files, and handling user input.

## Installation

You can install `simple2encrypt` using `pip`:

```
pip install simple2encrypt
```

## Usage

The `simple2encrypt` library offers the following functions for encryption, decryption, and file operations:

### Folder Encryption/Decryption

The library provides two functions for encrypting and decrypting files within a specified folder using the AES encryption algorithm. The encryption and decryption are performed on each file within the folder and its subfolders.

#### `encrypt_walk_dirs(folder_path: str, key: bytes, extension: str = '.enc') -> None`

Walks through the specified folder path and encrypts all files using the provided AES key.

- `folder_path` (str): The absolute folder path to walk on and encrypt files within.
- `key` (bytes): The AES key used for encryption.
- `extension` (str): Optional. The extension to add to the new encrypted file. Defaults to '.enc'.

**Raises:**

- `PermissionError`: If there is a permission error while accessing or modifying files.
- `FileExistsError`: If a file with the new name already exists in the destination.
- `FileNotFoundError`: If the specified file is not found.
- `ValueError`: If there is an error in the provided data or key.

#### `decrypt_walk_dirs(folder_path: str, key: bytes) -> None`

Walks through the specified folder path and decrypts all files using the provided AES key.

- `folder_path` (str): The absolute folder path to walk on and decrypt files within.
- `key` (bytes): The AES key used for decryption.

**Raises:**

- `PermissionError`: If there is a permission error while accessing or modifying files.
- `FileExistsError`: If a file with the new name already exists in the destination.
- `FileNotFoundError`: If the specified file is not found.
- `ValueError`: If there is an error in the provided data or key.

### Other Utility Functions

#### `delete_extension(file_path: str) -> str`

Removes the file extension from the given file path and returns the resulting filename without the extension.

- `file_path` (str): The path of the file with an extension.

#### `generate_key(password: str, length: int) -> bytes`

Generates an encryption key based on the provided password and length.

- `password` (str): The password for key generation.
- `length` (int): The length of the key (choose from [16, 24, 32]).

#### `read_binary(file_path: str) -> bytes`

Reads binary data from the specified file and returns it as bytes.

- `file_path` (str): The path of the file to read.

#### `write_binary(file_path: str, data: bytes) -> None`

Writes the given binary data to the specified file.

- `file_path` (str): The path of the file to write.
- `data` (bytes): The binary data to write.

#### `custom_input(question: str) -> str`

Prompts the user with the provided question and returns their input as a string.

- `question` (str): The question to ask the user.

### Command-Line Interface

The library also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for creating a new encryption key and performing file encryption and decryption.

#### Creating Encryption Key (Command Line)

To create a new encryption key file based on a provided password, use the following command:

```
aes-key [file_name] [secret_password]
```

This command will create a new encryption key file with the specified `file_name` and `secret_password`. The resulting key file will be saved as `key.bin` by default.

#### Encrypting Files (Command Line)

To encrypt a file using an encryption key, use the following command:

```
aes-encrypt [file_path] [key_path]
```

This command will encrypt the file at `file_path` using the encryption key at `key_path`. The encrypted file will be created with the same name as the original file and an added extension.

#### Decrypting Files (Command Line)

To decrypt an encrypted file using an encryption key, use the following command:

```
aes-decrypt [file_path] [key_path]
```

This command will decrypt the encrypted file at `file_path` using the encryption key at `key_path`. The decrypted 
file will replace the original encrypted file.

**Note:** Ensure that the necessary file paths and encryption keys are provided for the command-line interface to work correctly.
