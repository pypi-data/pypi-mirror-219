## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2023-07-13

### Changed
- Support of Python >= 3.8

## [0.2.2] - 2023-06-26

### Fixes
- Add missing `packaging` dependency

## [0.2.1] - 2023-06-22

### Added
- A new parameter `--sort-method` allows user to choose how pictures should be sorted, either by their date/time or file name, in ascending or descending order. Default is now by date/time ascending (was previously by filename ascending).
- A new `--version` parameter to get the geovisio_cli version

### Changed
- A new warning is displayed on every command if the package version is not the latest

### Fixes
- Uploading twice the same sequence do not print any misleading errors

## [0.2.0] - 2023-05-24

### Added
- A new `--token` parameter to `geovisio upload` to provide a custom geovisio token for authentication.
- A new `geovisio login` command to login on a geovisio instance

### Changed
- If a geovisio instance has a mandatory login for upload, the upload will ask to register the computer in the user's account first, if the user has not done a `geovisio login` first

### Removed
- Giving a user/password to `geovisio upload` is deprecated, authentication should use a token.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-05-17

### Added
- A new `--title` parameter to `geovisio upload` and `geovisio test_process` to provide a title to the uploaded collection. If no title is given, it will default to the directory name.
- Broken uploads can now be recovered: if on a first upload try, some pictures fail, you can re-launch a second upload try by running the same `upload` command. The `_geovisio.toml` stores in a sequence folder which pictures were correctly sent, thus skip them on next try.

### Changed
- Command `test-process` generates a `_geovisio.toml` file in the sequence folder. This file can be edited before running command `upload` to change picture ordering.
- Increase timeout to geovisio and add better error when a timeout happen or when a connection is lost


## [0.0.5] - 2023-04-27

### Fixed
- Add a timeout to avoid `requests` module to hang forever if API is not responding


## [0.0.4] - 2023-04-14

### Changed
- Changed the `--path` option of the `geovisio upload` command to a positional argument since it seems more ergonomic. So now `geovisio upload --api-url <some_url> --path <some dir>` is replaced by `geovisio upload --api-url <some_url> <some dir>` (or `geovisio upload <some dir> --api-url <some_url>` since the parameters order is not relevant)
- Improve some error messages

## [0.0.3] - 2023-04-12

### Added
- A new `--is-blurred` flag is available on upload command to inform API that it doesn't need to blur pictures


## [0.0.2] - 2023-04-07

### Fixed
- Pictures were not sorted in alphabetical or numeric order
- Add a `--wait` flag to the upload command to wait for geovisio to have processed all pictures
- Add a `geovisio collection-status` command, to get the status of a collection


## [0.0.1] - 2023-03-14

### Added
- Basic scripts for uploading pictures to a GeoVisio API
