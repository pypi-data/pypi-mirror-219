# python-groovy-parser

Python package which implements a Groovy 3.0.X parser, using both Pygments, Lark and the corresponding grammar.

The tokenizer, lexer and grammar have being tested, stressed and fine tuned
to be able to properly parse both Nextflow (i.e. `*.nf`), `nextflow.config`-like files
and real Groovy code from:

* https://github.com/nf-core/modules.git
* https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git
* https://github.com/nf-core/viralintegration.git
* https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon.git
* https://github.com/wombat-p/WOMBAT-Pipelines.git
* https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow.git

## Install
You can install the development version of this package through pip just running:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/inab/python-groovy-parser.git
```

## Test programs

This repo contains a couple of test programs called
[translated-groovy3-parser.py](translated-groovy3-parser.py) and
[cached-translated-groovy3-parser.py](cached-translated-groovy3-parser.py),
which demonstrate how to use the parser and digest it a bit.

The programs take one or more files as input.

```bash
git pull https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git
translated-groovy3-parser.py $(find rnaseq -type f -name "*.nf")
```

If an input file is for instance `rnaseq/modules/local/bedtools_genomecov.nf`,
the program generates a log file `rnaseq/modules/local/bedtools_genomecov.nf.lark`,
where the parsing traces are stored (emitted tokens, parsing errors, etc...).

Also, when the parsing task worked properly, it condenses and serializes
the parse tree into a file with extension `.lark.json` (for instance,
`rnaseq/modules/local/bedtools_genomecov.nf.lark.json`).

And as a proof of concept, it tries to identify features from Nextflow files,
like the declared processes, includes and workflows, and they are roughly printed
at a file with extension `.lark.result` (for instance `rnaseq/modules/local/bedtools_genomecov.nf.lark.result`).

As parsing task is heavy, the parsing module also contains a method to
be able to cache the parsed tree in JSON format in a persistent store,
like a filesystem. So, next operation would be expensive the first time,
but not the next ones:

```bash
GROOVY_CACHEDIR=/tmp/somecachedir cached-translated-groovy3-parser.py $(find rnaseq -type f -name "*.nf")
```

The caching directory contents depend on the grammar and the implementations, as well as versions of the dependencies.
So, if this software is updated (due grammar is updated or a bug is fixed),
cached contents from previous versions are not reused.

# Acknowledgements

The tokenizer is an evolution from Pygments Groovy lexer https://github.com/pygments/pygments/blob/b7c8f35440f591c6687cb912aa223f5cf37b6704/pygments/lexers/jvm.py#L543-L618

The Lark grammar has been created from https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/3b6909a3dbb574e66f5d0fb6aafb6e28316033a8/src/antlr/GroovyParser.g4 ,
converting it to EBNF using https://bottlecaps.de/convert/ ,
translating the EBNF representation to Lark format partially by hand.

Some fixes were inspired on https://github.com/daniellansun/groovy-antlr4-grammar-optimized/tree/master/src/main/antlr4/org/codehaus/groovy/parser/antlr4
