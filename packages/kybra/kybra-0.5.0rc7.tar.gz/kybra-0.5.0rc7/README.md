# Kybra (Beta)

Python CDK for the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

## Disclaimer

Things to keep in mind:

-   Kybra does not yet have many live, successful, continuously operating applications deployed to the IC
-   Kybra does not yet have extensive automated property tests
-   Kybra does not yet have multiple independent security reviews/audits

## Documentation

See [The Kybra Book](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/).

## Discussion

Feel free to open issues or join us in the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ux2Jc7psjd).

## Roadmap

The following are the major blockers to 1.0:

-   Majority stdlib support (~Q2/Q3 2023)
-   Extensive automated property testing (~Q1/Q2 2023)
-   Multiple independent security reviews/audits (~Q3 2023)
-   Performance improvements if necessary (~2023)

## Contributing

Not currently taking contributions, but definitely taking issues and questions. Please allow time for initial code architecture and governance/legal/token work to be put in place. Kybra will most likely have a license extension [similar to Azle's](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/blob/main/LICENSE_EXTENSION.md).
