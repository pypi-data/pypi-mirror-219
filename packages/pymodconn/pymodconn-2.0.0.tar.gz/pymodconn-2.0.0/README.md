# _pymodconn_ : A Python package for developing modular sequence to sequence control-oriented deep neural networks

![alt text](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/master/Readme_images/FIG1.png)

A control-oriented deep neural network (CONN) is a deep neural network designed to predict the future behaviour and response of complex dynamic systems, taking into account *Known past data* and *Known future data*. 
- *Known past data* includes historical information such as weather data, time information, system dynamics, and control inputs, which are used to train the CONN to understand the relationships between these variables and their effects on the system. 
- *Known future data* encompasses forecasted weather data, time information, schedules, and most importantly targeted control inputs, representing the expected conditions and desired actions that the system will be subject to in the future. 

The CONN leverages this information to predict future, i.e., *Unknown future data*, referring to the system dynamics or states that are not yet known. This prediction enables the control system to anticipate changes in the environment and adapt its actions, accordingly, ensuring optimal performance and robustness in spite of uncertainties.

# Installation
*pymodconn* can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), a tool for installing Python packages. To do it, run the following command:
```
pip install pymodconn
```

# Requirements
*pymodconn* requires Python >= 3.9.16 or later to run. Note that you should have also the following packages installed in your system:
- jsonschema==4.17.3
- numpy==1.24.3
- PyYAML==6.0
- ruamel.base==1.0.0
- tensorflow==2.12.0

# Usage
## Step 1: Loading the configurations as a dictionary
The users can design their CONN using a text-based configuration file. The details of this configuration file is discussed in next section ([Configuration file details](#configuration-file-details)). The configuration file can be loaded as a dictionary for use using [get_configs()](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/c1daed967501524311dbbe085b986b7f3c356d45/pymodconn/configs/configs_init.py#L24C7-L24C7). User can furthur change contents of configuration dictionary before using it to develop Keras model
```python
from pymodconn.configs.configs_init import get_configs

MODEL_CONFIG_FILENAME = 'default_config.yaml'
configs = get_configs(MODEL_CONFIG_FILENAME)
configs['n_past'] = 25 #Number of past observations timesteps to be considered for prediction
configs['n_future'] = 10 #Number of future predictions timesteps to be made
configs['known_past_features'] = 2 #Number of features in the past observation window data
configs['known_future_features'] = 3 #Number of features in the future prediction window data
configs['unknown_future_features'] = 2 #Number of features in the future prediction window data 
```
## Step 2: Develop Keras model using configurations dictionary
To differentiate model details the user can choose to use a unique indentation. For example this unique identifier string (ident) is created by appending the current time string to a predefined text. This identifier is used to differentiate between multiple runs or cases and for generating unique filenames when saving the model and prediction results.

Finally to develop the Keras model, the [Model_Gen(configs, ident)](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/c1daed967501524311dbbe085b986b7f3c356d45/pymodconn/model_gen.py#L14C11-L14C11) class is instantiated with the loaded configurations and the current run's identifier. The [build_model()](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/c1daed967501524311dbbe085b986b7f3c356d45/pymodconn/model_gen.py#L43) method is then called to create the Keras model object.

The model returned from **build_model()** can be used similarly to a Keras-based model. The user can run *keras.model.fit()*, *keras.model.train_on_batch()*, *keras.model.evaluate()*, or *keras.model.save()* as needed. A  [full implementation example](#full-implementation-example---model-developement-and-training-using-keras) is shown later.

```python
from pymodconn import Model_Gen

# 'ident' is a string used to ensure unique file and prediction case names
ident = 'test_'
current_run_dt = ident + str(dt.datetime.now().strftime('%d.%m-%H.%M.%S'))

# Initialize and build the model using
model_class = Model_Gen(configs, ident)
model_class.build_model()
model_class.model.fit(....)
model_class.model.evaluate(....)
model_class.model.save(....)
```

# Configuration file details

As discussed in previous section, users can design their CONN using a text-based .yaml file. YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data serialization format that is commonly used for configuration files due to its simplicity and readability. It facilitates implementation with various network architectures, promotes modularity and enables the reuse of predefined models, thus improving efficiency and reducing coding errors. The approach simplifies hyperparameter tuning, a critical aspect of neural network performance, by isolating these parameters in a configuration file.

This file can be generated by providing config_filename = None in the get_configs(config_filename) function or obtained from the package's GitHub repository [default_config.yaml](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/master/pymodconn/configs/default_config.yaml).

The first option creates a template of the configuration file in the current directory of the Python program, which users can modify with the desired parameters. With the latter approach, users can download a template configuration file, along with an assortment of config files corresponding to various predefined model architectures. The users can use config files for predefined model architectures as starting point.

To avoid errors and ensure correct operation, it is recommended that users do not alter the key names or the data types of the values in the key-value pairs within the configuration file. Maintaining this structure is essential for the Python package to function correctly. Following section gives more details of YAML configuration file lin-by-line.

The CONN structure includes an Encoder block processing known past data, and one or more Decoder blocks handling known future data. The Encoder block generates a sequence of encoded states reflecting the temporal structure of past data, and a final state summarizing this data. Each Decoder block receives these outputs; the encoded states serve as a temporal context, while the final encoder state initializes the Decoder block.

# Full implementation example - Model developement and training using Keras

Within the same directory as the default_config.yaml file, three additional configuration files are accessible. These files represent CONNs built on three recognized time series prediction mechanisms: RNNs - [CONN_based_on_biLSTMs_with_Bahdanau_attention.yaml](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/master/pymodconn/configs/CONN_based_on_biLSTMs_with_Bahdanau_attention.yaml), MHA - [CONN_based_on_MHA.yaml](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/master/pymodconn/configs/CONN_based_on_MHA.yaml), and TCN - [CONN_based_on_TCN_with_Bahdanau_attention.yaml](https://github.com/gaurav306/pymodconn/blob/master/pymodconn/configs/CONN_based_on_TCN_with_Bahdanau_attention.yaml).
