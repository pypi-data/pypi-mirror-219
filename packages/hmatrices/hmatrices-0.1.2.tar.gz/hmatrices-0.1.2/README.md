# hmatrices

A simple wrapper of the *Julia* library
[HMatrices.jl](https://github.com/WaveProp/HMatrices.jl) so that can be
easily installed and called from *Python*. It uses
[JuliaCall](https://pypi.org/project/juliacall/) for calling *Julia* from *Python*

See the `examples` folder, as well as the [HMatrices.jl
documentation](https://waveprop.github.io/HMatrices.jl/stable/) for more
details.
