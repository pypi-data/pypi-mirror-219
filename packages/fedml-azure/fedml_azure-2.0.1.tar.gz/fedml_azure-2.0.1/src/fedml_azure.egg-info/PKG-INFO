## Introduction

The SAP Federated ML Python libraries (FedML) applies the Data Federation architecture of SAP Datasphere for intelligently sourcing data for Machine Learning experiments done at the Hyperscalers thereby removing the need for replicating or moving data. 
By abstracting the Data Connection, Data load, and Model training (with flexibility and provision for user provided training scripts) for Hyperscaler Machine learning processes, the FedML library  provides end to end integration with few lines of code.

## Installation

Install the SAP FedML Azure library using pip as follows:

`pip install fedml-azure`
