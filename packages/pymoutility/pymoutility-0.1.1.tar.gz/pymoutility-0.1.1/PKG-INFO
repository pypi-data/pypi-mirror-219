# 🚀 PyMOUtility

A handy collection of helper functions, decorators, and utilities designed to streamline and simplify your Python 🐍 development experience. PyMOUtility is an open-source project that provides powerful tools to make your code cleaner, more readable, and easier to debug.

## ⚙️ Installation

PyMOUtility uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management. To install PyMOUtility, make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher and Poetry installed on your system.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/pyMOUtility.git
cd pyMOUtility
```

Please replace 'username' with the actual username of the repository.

Then, install the dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies.

You can then use PyMOUtility within this virtual environment or build it for usage elsewhere.

If you wish to build a distribution package, use:

```bash
poetry build
```

This will produce a .whl file in the `dist/` directory that you can install using pip:

```bash
pip install dist/pyMOUtility-*.whl
```

Please replace '*' with the actual version of the PyMOUtility package.

Remember to always activate the virtual environment created by Poetry before using the package:

```bash
poetry shell
```

This command will spawn a shell within the virtual environment. If you want to leave the virtual environment, simply exit the shell.

## ✨ Features

* **🛠️ Helper Functions**: A collection of functions to help handle and manipulate data more efficiently.
* **🖼️ Decorators**: Save time on writing repetitive code blocks with these ready-to-use decorators.
* **🔍 Error Handlers**: Tools for handling and debugging exceptions gracefully.

## 📖 Usage

Import the required utility from the PyMOUtility package. Here's a simple example:

```python
from pymoutility.decorators import timeit

@timeit(print)
def my_function():
    ...

my_function() # this will print the time taken to execute my_function
```
