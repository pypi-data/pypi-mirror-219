        - imin_est     (float)             : minimum current for use in inverse regression. Below this value, the standard curve must be extrapolated, which is poor practice.

        - To define a parabolic standard curve complete with prediction intervals, an error propagation formula for use with the delta method, 
          limits of estimation, and details about the creation of the curve, including smoothing parameters, baseline subtraction parameters,
          and calibration procedures.
    
    Attributes:
        - fit_params   (1D array/float) : An array containing the values of the fit coefficients of the parabola. form: [p0, p1, p2], where parabola(x) = p2*x^2 + p1*x + p0

   Function: get_groupwise_intervals
    
    Purpose:
        The purpose of this function is to group the input data and then calculate the the means, confidence bands, and prediction bands 
        of each groups. A group is defined by a fixed value of xdom. If many points have the same value of xdom, then they form a group.
        
        The function will output a the interpolated means, confidence interval edges, prediction interval edges, and standard deviations
        of each group. 
        
    Input:
        - xdom (array/float) : an array of points defining the x-coordinates of observations
        - yran (array/float) : an array of points defininf the y-coordinates of observations
        
    Output:
        - outList (list) : list containing 7 arrays
                                1. xUnique    (array/float) : contains the unique xdom values that define the groupings
                                2. means      (array/float) : contains the mean of each group
                                3. sampleSigs (array/float) : the SAMPLE standard deviation of each group (n-1 denominator)
                                4. CILow      (array/float) : lower limits of the CI for the mean of each group
                                5. CIUpp      (array/float) : upper limits of the CI for the mean of each group
                                6. PILow      (array/float) : lower limits of the PI for new observations from each group
                                7. PIUpp      (array/float) : upper limits of the PI for new observations from each group
                                
                        Note that the ith entry in each of the 7 arrays are associated with each other. That is, the ith entry in each array
                        defines a property of the ith group.
                        
                        Note that the limits are calculated at the 95% confidence level and assuming normality of data (i.e. the typical 
                        Student's t multiple of the [group] sample standard deviation. The results may therefore be erroenous for non-normally
                        distributed data.

   Function: moving_average_baseline_subtraction(current, window_size, forward = True)
    Purpose:
        An iterative function that estimates the baseline of an input signal using a peak-stripping 
        moving average (i.e. a moving average algorithm designed to strip baselines off of peaks.) 
        The function is intended to be used on voltammograms collected via sweep-like voltammetry.




    Input:
        - current (array/float) : An array of values intended to be a peak-like signal with baseline
        - window_size (int)     : An integer indicating the number of points to be contained in a single window
                                of the moving average
        - forward (boolean)     : This variable is relevant in the context of voltammetric sweep-like data collection.
                                If true, the data in "current" was collected via a sweep-like voltammetric scan where
                                the potential/voltage was swept from a starting value to an increasingly positive
                                potential. If False, the potential/voltage swept from a starting value to increasingly
                                negative values.
                                The objective is essentially to ensure that peak-like structures in the data are "above"
                                the baseline - i.e. more positive than the baseline. If the peaks manifests below the 
                                baseline in your data (i.e. "trench-like" as opposed to peak-like), set this variable to 
                                False, and the algorithm will adjust itself accordingly.
      

  
    Output:
        - baseline (array/float)           : An array of values containing the BASELINE estimate of the algorithm

   Function: make_pretty(ax, title='', xTitle='', yTitle='')
    Purpose: This function makes a few basic cosmetic adjustments to an input axes object.
             The objective is to serve as a "quick and dirty" way to make a plot more presentable.

    Input:
        - ax     (matplotlib axes object) : The axes object to which cosmetic adjustments will be made
        - title  (str)                    : Desired plot title

        - yTitle (str)                    : Desired y-axis label

    Output: 
        - There is no output. The orginal copy of ax is altered directly.



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Function: scatter_bygroup(ax, x,y,col,colmap='hot')    
    Purpose:
        - Plot y against x in a scatterplot, where the points are coloured by a third variable, col.

    Input:
        - ax  (matplotlib axis) : The axis on which to add the scatter plot
        - x   (array/float)     : The data for the x-axis of the scatterplot
        - y   (array/float)     : The data for the y-axis of the scatterplot
        - col (list)            : A list of values of some variable which will correspond to groups. This 
                                  value is used to determine the colour of a point. Points with the same 
                                  'col' value will have the same colour.
        - colmap (str)          : A colormap for determining the group colours. Default to 'hot'.

   Output:
	- Note that there is no output, however, the original input axes object will be altered.
