# DOCK SELENIUM

## Python only

This is a startup directory to write the selenium scripts in python along with some customization.

### Steps.
1. `pip install dock-py-selenium`
2. Create a `test.py` file in your root directory and write your test scripts.
3. Always bind any selenium script with the instance.


## Features

1. Setting a custom wait time for the webdriver `test_instance.wait(5)`
2. Settting the number of times a test should be performed `test_instance.rerun(3, lambda: run())`
3. Getting the title of the page `test_instance.getTitle()`
4. Checking whether the button or input type submit is clickable `test_instance.checkClick("button")` or `test_instance.checkClick("input")`
5. Checking the presence of an element in a webpage `test_instance.checkElement("CLASS_NAME","container")`


<mark> Note that, this project is still experimental and hence does not support the full render wait time for any test actions. </mark>
