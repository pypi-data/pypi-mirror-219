Testing and Building Release
============================

Testing is done by running the cocos-testcmp app which runs the unittests in utest/ and helps compare snapshots of tests/

See the cocos-testcmp readme for details, https://github.com/los-cocos/cocos-testcmp

Normal testing, like the one needed with a PR involves at the least one run with cocos-testcmp

To release a new version of cocos use tools/release_checklist.txt and release_checklist_details.html
