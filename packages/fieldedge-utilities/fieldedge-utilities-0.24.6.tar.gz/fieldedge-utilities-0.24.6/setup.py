Generally this library is meant to be used\non single board computers capable of running Debian Linux.\n\n>*While the authors recognize Python has several shortcomings for embedded use,*\n*it provides a useful learning template.*\n\nThis library available on [**PyPI**](https://pypi.org/project/fieldedge-utilities/)\nprovides:\n\n* A common **`logger`** format and wrapping file facility with UTC timestamps.\n* A **`timer.RepeatingTimer`** utility (thread) that can be started, stopped,\nrestarted, and interval changed.\n* A simplified **`mqtt`** client that automatically (re)onnects\n(by default to a local `fieldedge-broker`).\n* Helper functions for managing files and **`path`** on different OS.\n* An interface for the FieldEdge **`hostpipe`** service for sending host\ncommands from a Docker container, with request/result captured in a logfile.\n* Helper functions **`ip.interfaces`** for finding and validating IP interfaces\nand addresses/subnets.\n* A defined set of common **`ip.protocols`** used for packet analysis and\nsatellite data traffic optimisation.\n* Helpers for managing **`serial`** ports on a host system.\n* Utilities for converting **`timestamp`**s between unix and ISO 8601\n* **`properties`** manipulation and conversion between JSON and PEP style,\nand derived from classes or instances.\n* Classes useful for implementing **`microservice`**s based on MQTT\ninter-service communications and task workflows:\n    * **`interservice`** communications tasks and searchable queue.\n    * **`microservice`** class for consistent abstraction and interaction.\n    * **`msproxy`** microservice proxy class form a kind of twin of another\n    microservice, as a child of a microservice.\n    * **`feature`** class as a child of a microservice, with routing of MQTT\n    topics and messages and interaction with a simple task queue.\n    * **`propertycache`** concept for caching frequently referenced object\n    properties where the query may take time.\n    * **`subscriptionproxy`** allows cascading of received MQTT messages to\n    multiple modules within a project framing a microservice.\n\n[Docmentation](https://inmarsat-enterprise.github.io/fieldedge-utilities/)\n',
