Private Lecture Automation contains tools that make managing private lectures easier.

These tools include:
- Sending out an introduction email to new potential clients (`send_introduction_email`)
- Creating a calendar event for the next lecture for a client (`send_calendar_event`)


You can find more information about the installation and the usage of these
tools in the <a href="https://pythonvilag.github.io/private-lecture-automation/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
