TODO
- IlluminaGermlineVariantCaller
    - "--mode regular" or "--mode skeleton" fails for translation
    - can't find input in the unwrap functions
- move <js> to <__UNTRANSLATED_JS__>

- docker permission issues
    - super fucked 
    - can we run docker as non-root? 

- --galaxy-build-images 
    - doesn't work if running on singularity as docker isn't running
    - "you have supplied "--build-galaxy-tool-images", but docker was not found"
    - can we make this work with singularity? 
    - can we detect whether singularity is running & tell users to swap to docker?

- get a pypi package ready for janis
    - avoids singularity / docker issues
