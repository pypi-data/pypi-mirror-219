This package is a plugin that generates an `package_info.py` file with variables containing values from pyproject.toml and git.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the `package-info` plugin is via the `self add` command of Poetry.

```bash
poetry self add poetry-plugin-package-info
```

If you used `pipx` to install Poetry you can add the plugin via the `pipx inject` command.

```bash
pipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-package-info
```

Otherwise, if you used `pip` to install Poetry you can add the plugin packages via the `pip install` command.

```bash
pip install poetry-plugin-plugin-package-info
```

## Usage

By default, the `package-info.py` file is generated only when using the `package-info generate-file` command in poetry,

```
poetry package-info generate-file
```

The plugin can be enabled to automatically patch wheel files after `poetry build` is run by adding the `patch-wheels` to the project pyproject.toml file.

```toml
[tool.poetry-plugin-package-info]
patch-build-formats = ['wheel', 'sdist']  # or can just do ['all']
```

The plugin can be re-configured in the pyproject.toml file, below are the options and their defaults.

```toml
[tool.poetry-plugin-package-info]

# Patch any .whl files produced by `poetry build`
patch-build-formats = []

# The path relative to the pyproject.toml file
package-info-file-path = "package_name_in_snake_case/package_info.py"

# Search parent directories (relative to pyproject.toml) for .git
git-search-parent-directories = false

# The formatter to format the generated package_info.py file.
formatter = "poetry-plugin-package-info.formatters.black:BlackContentFormatter"

# The generators to use to extract property values.
generators = {
    project = "poetry-plugin-package-info.generators.project:ProjectContentFormatter",
    git = "poetry-plugin-package-info.generators.git:GitContentFormatter",
}

template = """\
\"\"\"Auto-generated by poetry-plugin-package-info at {{ now().replace(microsecond=0).isoformat()  }}.\"\"\"\
{% for import in imports %}

{% endfor %}
class PackageInfo:
{% for property in properties %}\
{{ "    " }}{{property.property_config.variable_name}}: {{as_python(property.property_type)}} = {{as_python(property.property_value)}}
{% endfor %}
"""

# ordered list of variables to include in the file.
properties = [
    "project-name",
    "project-description",
    "project-version",

## How-to

### Change variable names

It is possible to override the name of the generated variable by expanding the properties section to

```toml
[tool.poetry-plugin-package-info]

properties = [
    "project-name",
    "project-description",
    "git-commit-id",
    { "property-generator" = "git", "property-name" = "is-dirty", "variable_name" = "clean_me" },
    { "property-name" = "git-is-dirty", "variable_name" = "clean_me_too" }
]

```
