## Description

The official NordVPN clients for both Windows and Linux have well-known limitations. For instance, in Windows, to list all servers of a specific country, you must use a search pattern like ```country_name #```, while in Linux, it is not possible at all. Additionally, the official clients hide the server's load and external IP, even if you know its identification code.

To address these limitations, the current project introduces a solution in the form of a system tray application. By placing an icon in the system tray, users can easily access a menu displaying the complete list of available NordVPN servers. The servers are conveniently categorized by continents and countries, allowing for effortless navigation. Moreover, the servers are ordered by their load, enabling users to select the server with the lowest load for optimal performance.

With just a few clicks, users can now connect to their desired server directly from the system tray, bypassing the restrictions and limitations present in the official NordVPN clients.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

To install NordVPN Tray, run the following command:

    pip install nordvpn-tray

## Usage

To launch NordVPN Tray:

 - **On Windows**, double-click the `nordvpn-tray.exe` (usually located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python##\Scripts`) or run the `nordvpn-tray` command from the command prompt.


 - **On Linux**, double-click the `nordvpn-tray` (usually located in `~/.local/bin`) or run the `./nordvpn-tray` command from the terminal.

## Common Issues

#### "ValueError: Namespace AppIndicator3 not available" (Linux Only)

This error message indicates that the `AppIndicator3` module, which the application uses to display tray icons on Linux, is not available on your system.

To resolve this issue, you will need to install the `libayatana-appindicator3-dev` package, which provides the necessary files and libraries for the `AppIndicator3` module. To install the package, use the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libayatana-appindicator3-dev
