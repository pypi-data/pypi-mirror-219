Jaxip - JAX-based Interatomic Potential
=======================================

Jaxip is an optimized Python library on basis of Google JAX that enables development of emerging 
machine learning interatomic potentials for use in computational physics, chemistry, material 
science. These potentials are necessary for conducting large-scale molecular dynamics simulations 
of complex materials with ab initio accuracy.
