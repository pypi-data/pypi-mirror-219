## ALAT: Advanced Linear Algebra Toolkit

ALAT project was developed for calculating linear algebratic 
problems automatically. Especially, in engineering and science,
linear algebratic problems are so hot topic. So, I've decided to 
write this project. 

Of course, I may have made mistake in some methods. Please, 
contact the with me over my e-mail address.

### Features

I've seperated this project into 4 parts  mainly. First is `Matrices`
class which contain the methods related to matrix operations. Second is 
`Vectors` class which contain the methods about vector operations. Third 
is `Apps` class which contain the common applications related with linear 
algebra. Fourth is `Crypts` which provide the cryptography 
operations in 4 step.
