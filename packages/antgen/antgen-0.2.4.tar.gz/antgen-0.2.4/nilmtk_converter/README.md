# Converting an ANTgen data set for NILMTK

## Requirements

The NILMTK converter for ANTgen relies on a small number of Python libraries to fully function. Install them by typing:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Workflow

1. Use ANTgen to create a synthetic dataset (see https://github.com/areinhardt/antgen for instructions)

2. Generate the required metadata by assigning each of the contained appliances a device type used in NILMTK.
This step is used to create compatibility with other data sets, so make sure to assign one of the NILMTK device
types to each of the (synthetic) appliances in the ANTgen output. In case of doubt, choose "unknown".

```bash
python3 generate_metadata.py ../output/
```

3. Use our NILMTK dataset exporter to create a HDF5 file:

```bash
python3 convert_antgen.py ../output/ ANTgen.h5 
```

4. Have fun with ANTgen in NILMTK

```python
from nilmtk import DataSet

ant = DataSet('ANTgen.h5')
elec = ant.buildings[1].elec
print(elec)
```

## Known Issues

### Issue with hdfdatastore module

In case you receive the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "convert_antgen.py", line 84, in <module>
    main()
  File "convert_antgen.py", line 49, in main
    convert_antgen(output_filename='../output/ANTgen.h5', input_path='../output/')
  File "convert_antgen.py", line 73, in convert_antgen
    store.put(str(key), df)
  File "/Users/christoph/anaconda/envs/antgen/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nilmtk/docinherit.py", line 46, in f
    return self.mthd(obj, *args, **kwargs)
  File "/Users/christoph/anaconda/envs/antgen/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nilmtk/datastore/hdfdatastore.py", line 171, in put
    expectedrows=len(value), index=False)
TypeError: put() got an unexpected keyword argument 'expectedrows'
```


Remove the keyword argument *expectedrows* from line 170 in `nilmtk/datastore/hdfdatastore.py`:

```python
self.store.put(key, value, format='table', index=False)
```
