        (NOTE: I only just NOW realized that the TclRAL join command provides an option to specify multiple renames

        at once, but hey, there's no harm in providing potentially superfluous functionality as it does at least
        handle the single rename case. - LS)

        Given an input relation, rename one or more attributes from old to new names. This is useful when you want
        to join two relvars on attributes with differing names.

        In SM xUML, it is common for an attribute with one name to reference another attribute of the same
        type but a different name, Employee_ID -> Manager, for exmaple.

        We often need to rename multiple attributes before performing a join, so the single attribute rename
        operation provided by TclRAL is executed once for each element of the names dictionary.

        TclRAL rename syntax:
            relation rename <relationValue> ?oldname newname ...?

        Multiple rename example in TclRAL:
            relation rename ${Attribute_Reference} To_attribute Name
            relation rename ${^relation} To_class Class

        (^relation) is the name of PyRAL's intermediate result session variable, so we are feeding
        the result of the first rename into the next.

        Here we select zero or more tuples that match the supplied criteria.

        In relational theory this is known as a restriction operation.

        TclRAL syntax:
            relation restrict <relationValue> <tupleVariable> <expression>

        TclRAL command example:
            relation restrict ${Attribute} t {[string match {<unresolved>} [tuple extract $t Type]] &&
                [string match {Elevator Management} [tuple extract $t Domain]]}

        Generated from this PyRAL input:
            relation: Attribute
            restriction: 'Type:<unresolved>, Domain:Elevator Management'

        :param relation: Name of a relation variable where the operation is applied
        :param restriction: A string in Scrall notation that specifies the restriction criteria
        :param svar_name: An optional session variable that holds the result
