 # ebook-converter
This is a published wheel for the 3-year-unmaintained [ebook-converter](https://github.com/gryf/ebook-converter) project, developed by gryf.

I (152334H) am merely publishing this wheel to PyPI so that I can use it in my own projects. It has a very slight modification: a hardcoded statement to ignore all images in all files. I was not responsible for 99.99% of the code present in the package.
