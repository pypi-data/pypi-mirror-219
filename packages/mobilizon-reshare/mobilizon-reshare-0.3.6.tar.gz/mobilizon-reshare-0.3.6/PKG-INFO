[![CI](https://github.com/Tech-Workers-Coalition-Italia/mobilizon-reshare/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Tech-Workers-Coalition-Italia/mobilizon-reshare/actions/workflows/main.yml)

The goal of `mobilizon_reshare` is to provide a suite to reshare Mobilizon events on a broad selection of platforms. This
tool enables an organization to automate their social media strategy in regards
to events and their promotion. 

# Platforms

`mobilizon-reshare` currently supports the following social platforms:

- Facebook
- Mastodon
- Twitter
- Telegram
- Zulip

# Usage

## Scheduling and temporal logic

The tool is designed to work in combination with a scheduler that executes it at
regular intervals. `mobilizon_reshare` allows fine-grained control over the logic to decide when
to publish an event, with the minimization of human effort as its first priority.

## Installation

`mobilizon_reshare` is distributed through [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mobilizon-reshare/) and [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/twcita/mobilizon-reshare). Use

```shell
$ pip install mobilizon-reshare
```

to install the tool in your system or virtualenv.

This should install the command `mobilizon-reshare` in your system. Use it to access the CLI and discover the available
commands and their description.

### Guix package

If you run Guix you can install `mobilizon-reshare` by adding our [Guix channel](https://git.sr.ht/~fishinthecalculator/mobilizon-reshare-guix#configure) to your `.config/guix/channels.scm`.




To run `mobilizon-reshare` from master you can run the following command from the root of the repository:

``` shell
$ guix time-machine -C channels-lock.scm -- install -L . mobilizon-reshare.git
```

## Run on your local system

Once you have installed `mobilizon_reshare` you can schedule the refresh from Mobilizon with your system's `cron`:

```bash
$ sudo crontab -l
*/15 * * * * mobilizon-reshare start
```

## Deploying through Docker Compose

To run `mobilizon_reshare` in a production environment you can use the image published to DockerHub. We also provide an example [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Tech-Workers-Coalition-Italia/mobilizon-reshare/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

# Contributing
