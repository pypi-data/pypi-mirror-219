This project is packaged using Hatch. If you need to install Hatch please refer to their documentation
https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/


You should be able to run the following command in the root directory for a general status
hatch status

Then from the root directory you can run
pip install ./

I would suggest while you are debugging issues to install it with the command below. Once you are done with your development you can uninstall. This allows you to make edits and test easier.
pip install -e ./
