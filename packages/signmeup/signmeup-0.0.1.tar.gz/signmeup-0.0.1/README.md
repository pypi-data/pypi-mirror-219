## Usage

To interact with the Sign-Me-Up API, you can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Here's how you can use Postman:

1. Install Postman on your machine from the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Launch Postman and create a new request.
3. Set the request method (e.g., POST, GET) and URL for the desired API endpoint.
4. Add any required headers or request parameters.
5. Send the request and view the response.

The following API endpoints are available:
