# tictactoetools

tictactoetools is a Python package that provides functionality for building games of Tic-Tac-Toe with customizable features
and storing the data of matches in a database.

# Installation

To install the tictactoetools package, you can use the following command:

```
pip install tictactoetools
```

# Usage

## Builtin Functions

The package includes several built-in functions that facilitate the gameplay and interaction with the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
These functions provide functionality for playing matches, creating new matches, prompting user input, managing player moves,
and handling rematch options. There are also builtin functions for working with the database (see "Database")

The builtin play() function is an example of how all the functions can work together to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game, as well
as logging data on the database.

## Database

The tictactoetools package includes several built-in functions that facilitate working with the database, such as logging
matches, retrieving player IDs, checking username existence, creating new users, and fetching player and match statistics.

The database for this package consists of the following tables:

### Table: players

- `player_id`: Unique identifier for each player.
- `username`: The username of the player.

### Table: matches

- `match_id`: Unique identifier for each match.
- `player1_id`: The ID of the first player in the match.
- `player2_id`: The ID of the second player in the match.
- `start_time`: The start time of the match.
- `end_time`: The end time of the match.
- `board`: The game board data for the match.
- `winner_id`: The ID of the player who won the match.

## Board Class

The `Board` class represents the internal Tic Tac Toe game board. It provides functionality to manage and display the board
state, check for a winner, mark cells with player symbols, and perform other board-related operations.

## Match Class

The `Match` class is a data class responsible for storing information about the players, start and end times of a match,
the board configuration, and the winner.
