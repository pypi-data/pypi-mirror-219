"""Test cases for features defined on glue.py module.

This file handles the definition of all test cases for testing GlueJobManager
class and its features. The idea is to isolate a test script for testing
sparksnake features delivered for users who want to develop Spark applications
using AWS Glue environment through a SparkETLManager class object with
mode="glue".
