# README #

PyLTSpice is a toolchain of python utilities design to interact with LTSpice and NGSpice Electronic Simulator.

## What is contained in this repository ##

* __LTSteps.py__
  An utility that extracts from LTSpice output files data, and formats it for import in a spreadsheet, such like Excel
  or Calc.

* __raw_read.py__
  A pure python class that serves to read raw files into a python class.

* __raw_write.py__
  A class to write RAW files that can be read by LTSpice Wave Application.

* __Histogram.py__
  A python script that uses numpy and matplotlib to create an histogram and calculate the sigma deviations. This is
  useful for Monte-Carlo analysis.

* __sim_batch.py__
  This is a script to launch Spice Simulations. This is useful because:

    - Can overcome the limitation of only stepping 3 parameters
    - Different types of simulations .TRAN .AC .NOISE can be run in a single batch
    - The RAW Files are smaller and easier to treat
    - When used with the RawRead.py and LTSteps.py, validation of the circuit can be done automatically.
    - Different models can be simulated in a single batch, by using the following instructions:
        - `set_element_model('D1', '1N4148') # Replaces the Diode D1 with the model 1N4148 `
        - `set_component_value('R2', '33k') # Replaces the value of R2 by 33k`
        - `set_parameters(run=1, TEMP=80) # Creates or updates the netlist to have .PARAM run=1 or .PARAM TEMP=80`
        - `add_instructions(".STEP run -1 1023 1", ".dc V1 -5 5") `
        - `remove_instruction(".STEP run -1 1023 1")  # Removes previously added instruction`
        - `reset_netlist() # Resets all edits done to the netlist.`

  Note: It was only tested with Windows based installations.

### raw_read.py ###

The example below reads the data from a Spice Simulation called
"TRAN - STEP.raw" and displays all steps of the "I(R1)" trace in a matplotlib plot

 ```python
from PyLTSpice import RawRead

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

LTR = RawRead("TRAN - STEP.raw")

print(LTR.get_trace_names())
print(LTR.get_raw_property())

IR1 = LTR.get_trace("I(R1)")
x = LTR.get_trace('time')  # Gets the time axis
steps = LTR.get_steps()
for step in range(len(steps)):
    # print(steps[step])
    plt.plot(x.get_wave(step), IR1.get_wave(step), label=steps[step])

plt.legend()  # order a legend
plt.show()
 ```   

### raw_write.py ###

The following example writes a RAW file with a 3 milliseconds transient simulation sine with a 10kHz and a cosine with
9.997kHz

 ```python
import numpy as np
from PyLTSpice import Trace, RawWrite

LW = RawWrite(fastacces=False)
tx = Trace('time', np.arange(0.0, 3e-3, 997E-11))
vy = Trace('N001', np.sin(2 * np.pi * tx.data * 10000))
vz = Trace('N002', np.cos(2 * np.pi * tx.data * 9970))
LW.add_trace(tx)
LW.add_trace(vy)
LW.add_trace(vz)
LW.save("teste_snippet1.raw")
 ```   

### sim_batch.py ###

This module is used to launch LTSPice simulations. Results then can be processed with either the RawRead or with the
LTSteps module to read the log file which can contain .MEAS results.

The script will firstly invoke the LTSpice in command line to generate a netlist, and then this netlist can be updated
directly by the script, in order to change component values, parameters or simulation commands.

Here follows an example of operation.

```python
from PyLTSpice import SimRunner
from PyLTSpice import SpiceEditor

# select spice model
LTC = SimRunner(output_folder='./temp')
LTC.create_netlist('Batch_Test.asc')
netlist = SpiceEditor('Batch_Test.net')
# set default arguments
netlist.set_parameters(res=0, cap=100e-6)
netlist.set_component_value('R2', '2k')  # Modifying the value of a resistor
netlist.set_component_value('R1', '4k')
netlist.set_element_model('V3', "SINE(0 1 3k 0 0 0)")  # Modifying the
netlist.set_component_value('XU1:C2', 20e-12)  # modifying a define simulation
netlist.add_instructions(
        "; Simulation settings",
        ".param run = 0"
)

for opamp in ('AD712', 'AD820'):
    netlist.set_element_model('XU1', opamp)
    for supply_voltage in (5, 10, 15):
        netlist.set_component_value('V1', supply_voltage)
        netlist.set_component_value('V2', -supply_voltage)
        print("simulating OpAmp", opamp, "Voltage", supply_voltage)
        LTC.run(netlist)

for raw, log in LTC:
    print("Raw file: %s, Log file: %s" % (raw, log))
    # do something with the data
    # raw_data = RawRead(raw)
    # log_data = LTSteps(log)
    # ...

netlist.reset_netlist()
netlist.add_instructions(
        "; Simulation settings",
        ".ac dec 30 10 1Meg",
        ".meas AC Gain MAX mag(V(out)) ; find the peak response and call it ""Gain""",
        ".meas AC Fcut TRIG mag(V(out))=Gain/sqrt(2) FALL=last"
)

# Sim Statistics
print('Successful/Total Simulations: ' + str(LTC.okSim) + '/' + str(LTC.runno))

enter = input("Press enter to delete created files")
if enter == '':
    LTC.file_cleanup()

# Sim Statistics
print('Successful/Total Simulations: ' + str(LTC.okSim) + '/' + str(LTC.runno))
```

### LTSteps.py ###

This module defines a class that can be used to parse LTSpice log files where the information about .STEP information is
written. There are two possible usages of this module, either programmatically by importing the module and then
accessing data through the class as exemplified here:

```python
from PyLTSpice.LTSteps import LTSpiceLogReader

data = LTSpiceLogReader("Batch_Test_AD820_15.log")

print("Number of steps  :", data.step_count)
step_names = data.get_step_vars()
meas_names = data.get_measure_names()

# Printing Headers
print(' '.join([f"{step:15s}" for step in step_names]), end='')  # Print steps names with no new line
print(' '.join([f"{name:15s}" for name in meas_names]), end='\n')
# Printing data
for i in range(data.step_count):
    print(' '.join([f"{data[step][i]:15}" for step in step_names]), end='')  # Print steps names with no new line
    print(' '.join([f"{data[name][i]:15}" for name in meas_names]), end='\n')  # Print Header

print("Total number of measures found :", data.measure_count)
```

The second possibility is to use the module directly on the command line
`python -m PyLTSpice.LTSteps <filename> `
The <filename> can be either be a log file (.log), a data export file (.txt) or a measurement output file (.meas)
This will process all the data and export it automatically into a text file with the extension (tlog, tsv, tmeas)
where the data read is formatted into a more convenient tab separated format. In case the <logfile> is not provided, the
script will scan the directory and process the newest log, txt or out file found.

### Histogram.py ###

This module uses the data inside on the filename to produce an histogram image.

```

### SemiDevOpReader.py ###

This module is used to read from LTSpice log files Semiconductor Devices Operating Point Information. A more detailed
documentation is directly included in the source file docstrings.

## Debug Logging
The library uses the standard `logging` module. Three convenience functions have been added for easily changing logging 
settings across the entire library. `PyLTSpice.all_loggers()` returns a list of all the logger's names, `PyLTSpice.set_log_level(logging.DEBUG)` 
would set the library's logging level to debug, and `PyLTSpice.add_log_handler(my_handler)` would add `my_handler` as a handler for 
all loggers.

### Single Module Logging
It is also possible to set the logging settings for a single module by using its name acquired from the `PyLTSpice.all_loggers()` 
function. For example:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Set up the root logger first

import PyLTSpice  # Import PyLTSpice to set the logging levels
PyLTSpice.set_log_level(logging.DEBUG)  # Set PyLTSpice's global log level
logging.getLogger("PyLTSpice.RawRead").level = logging.WARNING  # Set the log level for only RawRead to warning
```
Would set only `PyLTSpice.RawRead` file's logging level to warning while the other modules would remain at debug level. 
_Make sure to initialize the root logger before importing the library to be able to see the logs._
