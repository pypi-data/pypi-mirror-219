            The item_id of the currently active item. If item_id has not been
            specified for the active item, this will default to item-i, where
            i is the index (starting from 0) of the item.

        - loading_state (dict; optional):
            Object that holds the loading state object coming from
            dash-renderer.

            - is_loading (boolean; optional):
                Determines if the component is loading or not.

            - prop_name (string; optional):
                Holds which property is loading.

        - persisted_props (list of a value equal to: 'active_item's; default ['active_item']):
            Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing
            the component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop
            can normally be ignored.

        - persistence (boolean | string | number; optional):
            Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted
            when the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is
            truthy and hasn't changed from its previous value, a `value` that
            the user has changed while using the app will keep that change, as
            long as the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
            Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`.

        - persistence_type (a value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; default 'local'):
            Where persisted user changes will be stored: memory: only kept in
            memory, reset on page refresh. local: window.localStorage, data is
            kept after the browser quit. session: window.sessionStorage, data
            is cleared once the browser quit.

        - start_collapsed (boolean; default False):
            Set to True for all items to be collapsed initially.
