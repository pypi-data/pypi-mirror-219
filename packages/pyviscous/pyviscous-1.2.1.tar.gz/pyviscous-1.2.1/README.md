### Abstract
pyVISCOUS is the open-source code of VISCOUSm in Python. VISCOUSm is an improved copula-based framework for efficient global sensitivity analysis. It has the advantage that it can use existing model input (e.g., model parameters) and output (e.g., model responses) data to estimate Sobolâ€™ sensitivity indices. In comparison with the VISCOUS of Sheikholeslami et al. ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028435)), VISCOUSm improves the handling of marginal densities of the GMCM (Gaussian mixture copula model). 

Within the VISCOUSm framework, the following steps are included.

### Installation
#### From PyPI
```pip install pyviscous```

#### From source

Clone pyviscous with: ```git clone https://github.com/CH-Earth/pyviscous.git```

Then navigate to the pyviscous directory and install with: ```python setup.py install```

### Examples
We provide four example notebooks in the example directory. In each example, there are scripts to generate input-output data, set up and run VISCOUSm, and evaluate the sensitivity results.
