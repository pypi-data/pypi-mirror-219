# Flux Burst Plugin for Local

This is an example implementation for a bursting plugin for Flux.
In this case, a "local" burst references a cluster that might be accessible
on a shared cluster, such as SLURM. For early development, we are testing
in the context of simply starting a set of nodes that are alongside one another
in an allocation.

For instructions, see the [main flux-burst repository](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-burst).
