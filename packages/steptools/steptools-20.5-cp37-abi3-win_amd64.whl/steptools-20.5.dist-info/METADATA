# STEP Python Interface for Digital Twin Manufacturing

The `steptools` package wraps the STEP Tools APIs with a Python
interface for high-level operations on STEP-NC process descriptions
and STEP assemblies.  It also provides STEP data classes and ARM
concept indexes, previously only available in C++, for detailed work
in areas not covered by the high-level operations.

We are releasing this package with a license that allows anyone to
read models at least until the end of 2023.  Our goal is to simplify
use of STEP-NC process with existing CNCs and promote new
manufacturing experiments with STEP and STEP-NC models.  You can find
[STEP-NC sample data](https://ap238.org/stepncfiles/) on
[ap238.org](https://ap238.org).  The extension can also be used to
author new models, but this requires a separate license key.

Documentation, including example programs and detailed description of
the classes, can be found below:

- [Documentation](https://www.steptools.com/docs/stpython/)
- [Install and Setup](http://www.steptools.com/docs/stpython/howto_setup.html)
- [Example Making CNC Codes](https://www.steptools.com/docs/stpython/example/make_codes/)
- [STEP-NC sample data](https://ap238.org/stepncfiles/)

The ISO 10303 standards cover a broad range of industrial data.  You
can find diagrams of the STEP concepts (high-level, represented by a
graph of data objects) and data object (low-level, single normalized
instance) definitions below.  Click on any definition to get a text
description of its meaning.

- [STEP Data Definition - AIM](https://www.steptools.com/stds/stp_expg/aim.html)

The `steptools` package is built for Windows, Linux and MacOSX, on
Python 3.7 and up.

## About

STEP Tools, Inc. is a commercial software company that has been
building software infrastructure for STEP CAD, STEP-NC CAM/CNC, and
IFC BIM tools since 1991.  We have deep technical knowledge of the ISO
10303 and related standards.

The python interface is built on the STEP Tools v20 C++ libraries with
latest STEP AP242 and STEP-NC AP238 schemas covering digital twin
manufacturing, machine tool kinematics machining process enhancements,
full-fidelity semantic tolerances, tesselated models and point cloud
data, as well as the CAD assemblies with full-fidelity brep solid
geometry that made STEP indispensable since 1995.

For the past thirty years these C++ libraries have powered the product
data in commercial CAD, analysis, and visualization systems and are
the fastest and most reliable libraries for making, using, and
manipulating STEP, STEP-NC, IFC, and CIS/2.
