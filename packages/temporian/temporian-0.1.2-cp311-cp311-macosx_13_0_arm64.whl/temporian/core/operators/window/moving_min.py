    """Computes the minimum of values in a sliding window over the node.

    For each t in sampling, and for each index and feature independently,
    returns at time t the minimum of non-nan values for the feature in the window
    (t - window_length, t].

    If `sampling` is provided samples the moving window's value at each
    timestamp in `sampling`, else samples it at each timestamp in `input`.

    If the window does not contain any values (e.g., all the values are missing,
    or the window does not contain any sampling), outputs missing values.

    Example:
        ```python
        >>> a = tp.event_set(
        ...     timestamps=[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7],
        ...     features={"value": [np.nan, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20]},
        ... )

        >>> b = tp.moving_min(a, tp.duration.seconds(4))
        >>> b
        indexes: ...
            (6 events):
                timestamps: [0. 1. 2. 5. 6. 7.]
                'value': [nan 1. 1. 5. 10. 10.]
        ...

        ```

    See [`tp.moving_count()`](../moving_count) for examples of moving window
    operations with external sampling and indices.

    Args:
        input: EventSetNode for which to count the number of values in each feature.
        window_length: Sliding window's length.
        sampling: Timestamps to sample the sliding window's value at. If not
            provided, timestamps in `input` are used.

    Returns:
        EventSetNode containing the minimum of each feature in `input`.
