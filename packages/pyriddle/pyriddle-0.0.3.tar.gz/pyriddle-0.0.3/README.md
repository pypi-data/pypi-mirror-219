  <h1>PyRiddle</h1>
</div>

pyriddle is a Python package that aim to make User Interface easy and beautiful.

It uses Flask to make browser based fully customisable UI.

It (will, lol) provide a lot of responsive elements to work with, like :

- [ ] Diagrams
- [ ] Video streams
- [ ] Text streams

The goal is to make them separate from each other, so that the user can easily manage them as he want.

That's all for now, I have a lot of other ideas, like implementing a theme system, so that both Users and Servers can choose what theme to use... but for now, they are only ideas ;)
