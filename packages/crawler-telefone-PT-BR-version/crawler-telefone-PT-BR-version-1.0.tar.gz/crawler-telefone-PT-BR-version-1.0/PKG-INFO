# Crawler de buscar por telefones em sites.

Totally amateur and test project. This is my first project that I publish here. I won't keep updating because it's not my priority.

In order for you to use this package, please consider changing in the "main.py" file the DOMAIN (DOMINIO) variable and the URL variable for the website you want to fetch phone numbers from.

The script is all in Portuguese and I'm too lazy to change. Horrible code, enjoy
