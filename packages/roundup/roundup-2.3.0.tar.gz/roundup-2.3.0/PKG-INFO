Description: I'm proud to release version 2.3.0 of the Roundup issue
        tracker.  This release is a bugfix and feature
        release, so make sure to read `docs/upgrading.txt
        <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>`_ to
        bring your tracker up to date.
        
        The changes, as usual, include some new features and many
        bug fixes.
        
        Note that you should run ``roundup-admin ... migrate`` to
        update the database schema version. Do this before you use
        the web, command-line or mail interface and before any users
        access the tracker.
        
        You can download it with::
        
           pip download roundup
        
        then unpack and test/install the tarball. Also::
        
           pip install roundup
        
        (preferably in a virtual environment) can be used.
        
        Among the notable improvements from the 2.2.0 release are:
        
        * Dockerfile demo mode implemented. This allows quick evaluation as
          well as the ability to spin up a configured tracker to customise.
        
        * SQLite backends can use WAL mode to reduce blocking between readers
          and writers improving concurrent use.
        
        * Redis can be used for session database with SQLite and dbm
          backends. Provides a major performance improvement.
        
        * roundup-mailgw can use OAUTH authentication to SMTP
          server. (roundup-mailgw command line options changed as a result.)
        
        * Postgres full text index can now be enabled.
        
        * Modifications to in-reply-to threading when there are multiple
          matches resulting in more predictable handling of messages.
        
        * Many updates to documentation to make it scannable, useful and
          work on mobile.
        
        * Admin documentation includes a section on setting up Content
          Security Policy (CSP) to better secure your Roundup trackers.
        
        * REST now allows rate limiting headers to be accessed by client
          JavaScript.
        
        * Default number of rounds for PBKDF2 updated to 2M to account for
          improvements in password crackers and CPU power.
        
        * Support PBKDF2 with SHA512 for password storage to improve
          resistance to password crackers.
        
        * Deprecate SSHA password hash function.
        
        * roundup-admin reindex can be done in batches to manage load
          incurred by reindexing.
        
        * roundup-admin can list available templates and their installed
          locations. This is useful when installing via pip or in a docker
          container as supporting files are not stored in the usual locations
          like /usr/share/roundup.
        
        * Crash fixes in detector handling
        
        The file CHANGES.txt has a detailed list of feature additions and
        bug fixes (53) for each release. The most recent changes from
        there are at the end of this announcement. Also see the
        information in doc/upgrading.txt.
        
        If you find bugs, please report them to issues AT roundup-tracker.org
        or create an account at https://issues.roundup-tracker.org and open a
        new ticket. If you have patches to fix the issues they can be attached
        to the email or uploaded to the tracker.
        
        Upgrading
        =========
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        all the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the doc/upgrading.txt
        documentation.
        
        Note that you should run ``roundup-admin ... migrate`` for
        all your trackers to update the database schema version. Do
        this before you use the web, command-line or mail interface
        and before any users access the tracker.
        
        Roundup requires Python 2 newer than version 2.7.12 or Python 3 newer
        than or equal to version 3.6 for correct operation. (Python
        3.4 or 3.5 may work, but are not tested.) Note that Python 2 support
        is being removed from the CI platforms, so you should deploy new
        trackers with Python 3 and plan on upgrading older trackers from Python
        2 to Python 3. See the upgrade guide.
        
        To give Roundup a try, just download (directions above), unpack and run::
        
            python demo.py
        
        then open the url printed by the demo app.

        About Roundup
        =============
        
        Roundup is a simple-to-use and install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
        project is rouilj at users.sourceforge.net. Use this address for
        security or other sensitive issues. Development discussions occur on
        the roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list. Tickets can
        be opened at https://issues.roundup-tracker.org.
        
        Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
        "description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:
        
        (a) submit new issues,
        (b) find and edit existing issues, and
        (c) discuss issues with other participants.
        
        The system facilitates communication among the participants by managing
        discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
        the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
        is therefore usable "out of the box" with any Python 2.7.2+ (or 3.6+)
        installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
        though an install script is provided.
        
        It comes with five basic issue tracker templates
        
        * a classic bug/feature tracker
        * a more extensive devel tracker for bug/features etc.
        * a responsive version of the devel tracker
        * a jinja2 version of the devel template (work in progress)
        * a minimal skeleton
        
        and supports four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql and postgresql).
        
        Recent Changes
        ==============
        
        From 2.2.0 to 2.3.0
        
        Fixed:
        ------
        
        - Updated directions for verifying Roundup distribution using pgp.
        - Dockerfile healthcheck fixed so it works when trackers are
          specified on command line. Also cleanup of unneeded
          packages. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551224 - Replace dbm db for sessions and otks when using
          sqlite. New databases are created for session data (db-session)
          and one time key data (db-otk). The data is ephemeral so no
          need to migrate. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551223 - Timestamps are truncated in mysql and postgresql
          for session and otk database tables. Modify db schema to use a
          numeric type that preserves more significant figures. See
          upgrading.txt for required steps. (John Rouillard)
        - added more testing of BasicDatabase to support use of SQLite
          for that purpose. Had to fix memory, rdbms and dbm edge cases
          due to new tests. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551138 - roundup-server with ssl under python2 throws
          traceback on socket close. Not sure how this got fixed,
          but after fixing issue2551137 it was not an issue anymore.
        - issue2551137 - roundup-server won't run with ssl under python3
          Fixed by using SocketIO and manually adding buffering io and
          catching SSL.ZeroReturnError indicating SSL has been shut down.
        - add caching header for text/javascript in addition to depricated
          application/javascript. (John Rouillard)
        - Enable postgres-fts: fix indexer-common::get_indexer so it returns a
          postgresql-fts Test code paths in get_indexer. (John Rouillard)
        - Fix Postgres native-fts, implement a two phase initialization of the
          indexer. The native-fts one gets assigned after the database
          connection is open. (John Rouillard)
        - fix crash if postgresql native-fts backend is asked to index content
          with null bytes. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551232 - modify in-reply-to threading when multiple matches
          Change how in-reply-to threading works in the mailgw. If there is
          more than one issue with a matching parent message, fall back to
          subject matching. See upgrading.txt for details. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551195 - port scripts from optparse to argparse (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
        - issue2551246 - mitigation, document how -u doesn't work for
          roundup-admin. (John Rouillard)
        - Document better that files in the template or static_files
          directories accessed via @@file are available to any user with the
          url. (John Rouillard)
        - Fix final exception handler in roundup-server to send proper
          Content-Length header to the client. (John Rouillard)
        - Fix traceback if Origin header is missing. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551250: Fix sorting of detectors even if there are two with the
          same name and priority (can happen if they are created in two
          different files).
        - Fix Traceback when a numeric order attribute is empty (Ralf
          Schlatterbeck)
        - Update some template schema files to assign Register permissions for the
          Anonymous user. Replaces the old Create permission. (John Rouillard)
        - Allow '*' and explicit origins in allowed_api_origins. Only return 
          'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' when not matching '*'. Fixes
          security issue with rest when using '*'.  (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551263: In REST response expose rate limiting, sunset, allow
          HTTP headers to calling JavaScript.  (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551257: When downloading an attached (user supplied file),
          make sure that an 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' header is sent.
          (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551252 - default number of rounds for PKDF2 password increased
          to 2,000,000.  (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551251 - migrate/re-encrypt PBKDF2 password if stored
          password used a smaller number of rounds than set in
          password_pbkdf2_default_rounds.  (John Rouillard)
        - upgrade from jquery-3.5.1 to jquery-3.6.3. Update user.help.html
          to new version.  (John Rouillard)
        - Dockerfile scanned with hadolint. Fixed multiple issues. (John Rouillard)
        - fix crash due to invalid initialization/reset of configuration.py
          option_validators. Crashed roundup-admin on second command if an
          option_validator was added by a detector or extension. (John Rouillard)
        - Dockerfile uses dumb-init to properly wait for child/zombie
          processes. Defense against child process starting from detector
          and becoming a zombie when its roundup-server instance exits.
          (John Rouillard)
        - Move installed frontend/Zope back to frontend/ZRoundup
          directory. This better identifies the directory when copied into
          the Zope framework. It also matches existing
          documentation. (John Rouilard)
        - Multiple fixes/updates for installation documentation.
          Including docker shell/admin/demo mdoes. (John Rouillard)
        - Invalid item identifiers passed to REST endpoint return a 404
          rather than a 400 error. E.G. /rest/data/issue/issue4 (rather
          than .../issue/4). (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551280 - sorted() method of MultilinkHTMLProperty is broken?
          (Gabor Nagy report and fix; commit John Rouillard)
        
        Features:
        ---------
        
        - Add warning about limited Python 2 support lifetime to install and
          upgrading docs. (John Rouillard)
        - Dockerfile supports demo mode for instant gratification
          8-). Also supports shell and admin mode (John Rouillard)
        - Dockerfile build allows adding additional python packages via
          pip, setting UID tracker is run under. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551140 - Added redis as a session and otk database for use
          with anydbm and sqlite primary databases. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2550559 - Pretty printing / formatting for Number types.
          Added pretty(format='%0.3f') method to NumberHTMLProperty to
          print numeric values. If value is None, return empty string
          otherwise str() of value. (John Rouillard)
        - sqlite native-fts backend now uses the stopwords list in config.ini
          to filter words from queries. (Stopwords are still indexed so that
          phrase/proximity searches still work.) (John Rouillard)
        - sqlite databases use WAL mode when *created* to improve read
          concurrency. Existing sqlite database still use rollback journal
          mode. See upgrading.txt for details. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551233 - create new roundup-admin command "templates" list all
          template names, location and descriptions. Should help find where
          /usr/share/roundup/templates is buried during some install
          mechanisms. Does not need a tracker home to run. (John Rouillard)
        - Add OAuth authentication to the mailgw script. Now IMAPS can be used
          with OAuth as required by several large cloud providers. Move command
          line processing of the mailgw script to ``argparse``. Note that the
          command line options of the mailgw have changed, see upgrading.txt for
          details. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
        - issue2551243: schema-dump.py enhanced with anti-CSRF headers. Flake8
          cleanup and python2 support. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551253 - new password hash PBDKF2-SHA512 added. Not
          available by default. Follow directions in upgrading document
          to use.  (John Rouillard)
        - roundup-admin migrate command reports the schema version.
        - issue2551262 - the mail gateway subject prefix now allows spaces
          before/after prefix. Also allow spaces between classname and id
          number in prefix designator. So "[ issue 23   ] subject" is parsed
          like "[issue23] subject". (John Rouillard)
        - [doc]: add section on implementing CSP for Roundup to admin
          doc. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551265 - deprecate SSHA password hash method. Users using SSHA
          passwords will have their passwords transprently upgraded to PBKDF2
          derived hash on next login. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551253 - Modify password PBKDF2 method to use SHA512. New
          hash function using PBKDF2-SHA512 available. Will be default in
          future. Directions for upgrading security by using it now is
          included in upgrading.txt. (John Rouillard)
        - issue2551275 - Allow configuring max_children in roundup-server.
          When using roundup-server in fork mode, allow raising number of
          forked children above the default of 40. (Original patch by Joseph
          Myers, config settings and docs by John Rouillard.)
        - roundup-admin genconfig does not need a tracker home to run. (John
          Rouillard)
        - issue2551190 - Allow roundup-admin reindex to work in
          batches. Running roundup-admin -i ... reindex issue:1-1000 will
          reindex the first 1000 issues while reporting any missing issues
          in the range. Also completion progress is reported when indexing a
          specific class.
        - doc updates: add explanation for SQL code in 1.3.3->1.4.0 upgrade.
          document schema table in rdbms backends and how to dump/extract
          version from them. (John Rouillard)
