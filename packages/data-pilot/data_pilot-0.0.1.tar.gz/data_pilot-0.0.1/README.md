# Data Pilot

*DISCLAIMER: This is a work in progress and currently under development*.

Data Pilot is a python package that automates the process of using Language Models (e.g. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, StableLM, Vicuna40B) to perform Data Science tasks such as data-cleaning, data-preprocessing, data-analysis, and ML model training.

We recommend using OpenAI's models to perform these tasks as they will provide the best output. However, the user is free to choose between a range of different models.

To use data-pilot, you will need two APIs:

- An API for data source : e.g. Supabase, Databricks, or any other Database
- An API for language models : e.g. OpenAI , Replicate
