# ColdFront - Resource Allocation System

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/coldfront/badge/?version=latest)](https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

ColdFront is an open source resource and allocation management system designed to provide a
central portal for administration, reporting, and measuring scientific impact
of cyberinfrastructure resources. ColdFront was created to help high performance computing (HPC) centers manage access to a diverse set of resources across large groups of users and provide a rich set of
extensible meta data for comprehensive reporting. The flexiblity of ColdFront allows centers to manage and automate their policies and procedures within the framework provided or extend the functionality with [plugins](docs/pages/index.md#extensibility).  ColdFront is written in Python and released under the GPLv3 license.

- Collection of Project, Grant, and Publication data from users
- Center director approval system and annual project review process
- Email notifications for expiring/renewing access to resources
- Ability to define custom attributes on resources and allocations 
- Integration with 3rd party systems for automation, access control, and other system provisioning tasks
