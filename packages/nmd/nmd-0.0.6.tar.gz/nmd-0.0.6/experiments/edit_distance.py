    This distance is the number of additions, deletions, substitutions,

    second. Although generally used with strings, any sequences of
    comparable objects will work.

    Transpositions are exchanges of *consecutive* characters; all other
    operations are self-explanatory.

    This implementation is O(N*M) time and O(M) space, for N and M the
    lengths of the two sequences.

    Extended Edit Distance (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-5359)
    Calculates the (non-symmetric) EED from hypothesis to reference string
    https://github.com/averykhoo/extended-edit-distance/blob/master/EED.py

    Note: EED builds on CDER (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E06-1031)
    with default settings, the algorithm seems to:
    - skip the first char in each hyp word, even if it matches the ref
    - repeat the last hyp character until it sees a space in the ref
    - but it doesn't skip the first char if there's no jump
    - the c code stores the entire DP table for no reason
    other notes:
    - skipping the first char seems to be solved by setting jump cost to 0.9
    - setting jump cost higher than insertion cost tends to insert space as first word char
    - setting jump cost higher than substitution cost tends to insert random chars instead
    - rho changes nothing since it's computed at the end
    - attempts to integrate rho into the cost function failed miserably
