## How to use emvoice

**emvoice** is a pure Python package for computing emotion expression-related features from speech signals. It uses similar algorithms as in [Praat](https://www.praat.org) and [openSMILE](https://github.com/audeering/opensmile/) but also includes more recent methods from the [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) package. Currently, most low-level descriptor features from the extended Geneva Minimalistic Acousting Parameter Set ([eGeMAPS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160715)) are implemented.

Given that it is entirely written in Python, it is easier to include emvoice in other Python-based applications, especially if they use numpy or scipy.

## Getting started

Take a look at the [examples](https://emvoice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) to get started with emvoice.

## Installation

emvoice requires Python >=3.7 and can be installed via `pip`:

```console
pip install emvoice
```

To install the lastet development version from GitHub repository, do:

```console
