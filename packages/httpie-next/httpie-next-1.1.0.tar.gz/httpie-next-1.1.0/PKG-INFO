HTTPie Extra!
-------------

This plugin brings support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 to HTTPie.
Use this plugin with caution as it uses urllib3.future (and actually shadows urllib3 in your environment).

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Ousret/httpie-next -U

# run twice! first is http/2 and second should be http/3
https GET www.cloudflare.com/img/nav/globe-lang-select-dark.svg
```

When a server yield its QUIC support, it is saved in the default HTTPie configuration directory.
Installing this in your environment will alter basically everything that relies on urllib3.

Your feedback is appreciated so that we can prepare a safe (and actually reviewable / merge-able feature) in urllib3.
