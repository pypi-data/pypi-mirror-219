## Disclaimer

This repository is in early development and can be restructured at any time.
A much higher level of stability will be targeted after 1.0.0 release

## Install

```sh
## Node
npm i pwed-cdk

## Python
pip install pwed-cdk
```

## Constructs

1. static-site

   1. Is a simple static site that will automatically upload assets to s3 and serve them with CloudFront. Any pushed changed files will get invalidated from the CloudFront cache.
2. bastion

   1. windows-instance

      1. A windows instance that can be signed into using fleet manager for a zero surface area RDP bastion.
   2. permission-set

      1. AWS SSO permission set with the minimum permissions to give access to SSM and Fleet Manager
      2. Can be locked down with Tags if you want environment level access

## Coming soon

1. Non SSO based access for bastion
2. Hugo extension for static-site to auto build and deploy your static site
