# :warning: Important Notice for Ultralytics YOLOv8 Users

Please note that the `yolov8` Python package here is a placeholder and not the official package from Ultralytics. For the most reliable and up-to-date features, you should instead install the official `ultralytics` package at https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/.

To do this, simply run the following command in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

This will ensure you are using the most accurate, efficient, and maintained code for your YOLO models. Please see https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/ for full documentation on installing and getting started with Ultralytics YOLOv8. 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
