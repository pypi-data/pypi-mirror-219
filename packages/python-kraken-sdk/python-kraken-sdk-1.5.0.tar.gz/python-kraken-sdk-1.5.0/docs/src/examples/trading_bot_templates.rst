Trading Bot Templates
=====================

The `python-kraken-sdk`_ is perfectly suited to develop automated trading algorithms. To facilitate the start here directly
for Spot trading as well as for the Futures enthusiasts templates are provided, which can serve as the basis for dynamic trading algorithms.
In both cases the websocket endpoints are used to capture the live data. In addition REST clients are integrated,
so that their endpoints can be reached at any time.

For questions, feedback, suggestions for improvement or problems `python-kraken-sdk/discussions`_ or `python-kraken-sdk/issues`_ may be helpful.
