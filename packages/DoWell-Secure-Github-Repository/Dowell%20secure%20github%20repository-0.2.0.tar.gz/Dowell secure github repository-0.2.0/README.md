# Version: 1.0.0
# Description:
    
    This API seamlessly integrates with Github's webhooks, enabling automatic backups of code repositories. It provides real-time backups triggered by specified events, ensuring data protection. The API offers customization options, allowing developers to define backup frequency and scope. With robust encryption and disaster recovery mechanisms, the Secure Repository API ensures the integrity and availability of your code backups.
    
    The Secure Repository API offers a range of powerful features to enhance code backup:
    
    - Repository Clone: The API enables easy cloning of repositories, allowing you to create copies of your codebase. This functionality ensures that you have a complete and up-to-date backup of your repositories, ready for immediate use or restoration.
    - Webhooks Integration: With seamless integration with Github's webhooks, the API automatically triggers backups based on specified events. Whether it's a new commit, branch update, or pull request, the API captures these changes in real-time, ensuring that your backups are always up to date.
    - Backup Reports: The Secure Repository API generates comprehensive backup reports, providing valuable insights into the status and success of each backup operation. These reports include details such as backup timestamps, repository names, and any potential errors encountered during the backup process. These reports serve as a handy reference for tracking backup history and troubleshooting.
    - Repository Reports: In addition to backup reports, the API also generates repository reports, offering an overview of each repository's status and health. These reports provide information such as the number of commits, branches, and contributors, giving you a clear snapshot of your codebase's activity and progress.
