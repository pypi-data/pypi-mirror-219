This Python library provides an **intuitive** and **fast** interface over WebFlow's API. It simplifies the process of integrating your Python applications with the WebFlow content management system (CMS), allowing you to create, read, update, and delete items within your WebFlow collections.

**DISCLAIMER**  : This is an **unofficial** abstraction over WebFlow's API and I am not associated with the WebFlow team.


## Roadmap
- [ ] Add *e-commerce* functionality
- [ ] Add *membership* functionality
- [ ] Add tests
- [x] Finish documentation
- [x] Publish to PyPi


## Features
- **Authenticate** with the WebFlow API using your API key
- **Fetch**, **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** Items and files from WebFlow Collections
- Handle **pagination** for large Collections
- Hidden parallelization for **faster operations** (with implicit error handling)

## Installation
You can install the package using pip:
```bash
pip install fast-webflow
```

## Getting Started
1. Obtain an API key from WebFlow by following their [API Access Token](https://developers.webflow.com/docs/access-token).
2. Import the `cms` module from the `fast-webflow` package automatically to interact with the WebFlow CMS API; then authenticate:
```python
import webflow.cms as cms
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
cms.authenticate(api_key)
```

3. Start interacting with the WebFlow API using the provided methods. For example, to fetch all items from a collection:
```python
from webflow.cms import Collection

collection_id = 'COLLECTION_ID'
collection = Collection(collection_id)
items = collection.get_all_items()

for item in items:
    print(item["slug"])
```

## Examples
If you are quickly searching for a particular code snippet, I hope you can find it here. These all
assume that you *are already authenticated* (if not, see [the quickstart](#getting-started)).

### Create CMS Elements
Elements from the CMS are handled via classes, with relevant methods for each. Classes also behave like dictionaries, holding by default some basic information (fetched from the CMS at creation time).
```python
from webflow.cms import Site, Collection, Item

# connect to the Sites part of the API
site_id = 'YOUR_SITE_ID'
site = Site(site_id)

# connect to the Collections part of the API
collection_id = 'YOUR_COLLECTION_ID'
collection = Collection(collection_id)

# connect to the Items part of the API
item_id = 'YOUR_ITEM_ID'
item = Item(item_id)
```

### Fetch Data
```python
from webflow.cms import Site, Collection, Item

# get list of available sites
sites = cms.list_sites()
site_id = sites[0]['_id']

# connect to that site's CMS and get some data
site = Site(site_id)
assert site_id == site.id == site['_id']

collections   = site.get_collections()
domains       = site.get_domains()
site_details  = site.get_data()
site_name     = site['name']
```
```python
# connect to a collection in the CMS and get some data
collection_id = 'YOUR_CONNECTION_ID'
collection = Collection(collection_id)
items = collection.get_all_items()
```
```python
# connect to an item in the CMS and get some data
item_id = 'YOUR_ITEM_ID'
item = Item(item_id)
item_data = item.get_data()
```

### Publish Website
```python
from webflow.cms import Site

# connect to that site's CMS and publish it
site_id = 'YOUR_SITE_ID'
site = Site(site_id)
site.publish()

# you may specify custom domains too
site.publish(['www.first.domain.com', 'www.second.domain.com'])
```

### Upload Data
```python
from webflow.cms import Site, Collection, Item

new_items = [
  {
    'name': 'first item,
    'slug': 'item1
  },
  {
    'name': 'second item,
    'slug': 'item2
  },
]
added_items = collection.post_items(new_items)
```
