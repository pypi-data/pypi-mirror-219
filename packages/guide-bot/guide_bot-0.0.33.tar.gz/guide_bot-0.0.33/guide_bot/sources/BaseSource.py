class BaseSource:
    """
    Base class for a source used in optimization / characterization of a guide

    The BaseSource class is meant as a base class from which other classes can
    inherit the central features required for a source in guide_bot. It
    provides the basic parameters that is expected of every source, the logic
    for deciding distance from source to guide and addition of a gap between
    the source / guide. It does not contain code for providing a McStas source
    component in the add_to_instrument method, which the derived class needs
    to overwrite.

    The Parameter class used allow parameters in the set to be scanned by the
    user, so when a list is given in any number of the parameters, a N
    dimensional space is created that will be mapped. When using these
    parameters in the class, they can be accessed with self[key], and will
    have the appropriate value prepared before the methods of this class are
    called. It is highly advised that additional parameters are given in this
    same manner, as they can then be included in a scan without further work.

    Distance from Source to guide can be handled in a number of ways. The user
    can specify either a fixed distance or a range to the Source, and since
    these are parameters these can be scanned. Any choice made on the
    individual guides are set to overwrite these preferences, as it is then
    possible to test a range of different guides with different starting
    conditions.

    The Source is responsible for adding the space between source and the
    first guide element, which is usually a gap, but could be more advanced.
    A bispectral source could for example include a bispectral switch, and
    it is allowed to add free parameters which would optimize aspects of
    these added components.

        Base class for source used in optimization/characterization of guides

        Sources used in guide_bot should inherit from this class to ensure the

        rectangular area. The required wavelength area is determined by the
        target rather than the source, as it is only necessary to simulate
        rays with a wavelength inside that figure of merit. Parameters can be
        scanned to investigate a range of different source / target

        Creates instrument object meant for obtaining brilliance reference

        In order to calculate the brilliance transfer, a reference close to

        source described by this object, and a target. Brilliance transfer
        is the ratio of phase-space density, and so it is usually calculated
        by dividing the intensity from two identical monitors, one at the
        source and one at the investigated position. They both need to be
        closed phase-space volumes in the sense that they must have limits in
        wavelength, divergence and space. The limits can however be different
        if this is taken into account in the normalization, and that the
        density is assumed constant. In some instances it is needed to
        calculate brilliance transfer to a monitor larger than the moderator,
        and so the investigated monitor is decreased to a small size here
        and the smaller size is taken into account during the normalization.
        The brilliane monitors provided by the given target object are placed
        at such a distance so they are fully illuminated by the source, this
        distance is calculated for horizontal and vertical direction where
        the minimum is selected. This methods does not need to be overwritten
