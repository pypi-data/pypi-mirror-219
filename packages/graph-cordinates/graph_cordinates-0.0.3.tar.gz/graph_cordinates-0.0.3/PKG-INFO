How to use: 

1. import graph_cordinates.graph_cordinates as gc 

2. gc.get_graphcordinates(image_path,x_range,y_range,background_value) 

3. Will return an array of 2D cordinates: [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], .......n-points] ; n=pixel width of Image 

    
How to pass arguments- 

1. image_path == path to a graph image 

2. x_range == [Value of left most point on graph's x-axis, Value of right most point on graph's x-axis]

3. y_range == [Value of bottom most point on graph's y-axis, Value of top most point on graph's y-axis]

4. background_value == 0 or 1 

   0: When the graph's background color is relatively darker than the curve

   1: Otherwise)  


Caution- Try to pass the Image by erasing the axes
