DESCRIPTION = 'From Image of a curve/graph, extract and store the cordinates pairs in a 2D array '
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """ 
See the logic and an example implementation on my github\n
https://github.com/kumarUjjawal3621/mypython_lib \n

How to use: \n
1. import graph_cordinates.graph_cordinates as gc \n
2. gc.get_graphcordinates(image_path,x_range,y_range,background_value) \n
3. Will return an array of 2D cordinates: [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], .......n-points] ; n=pixel width of Image \n
    
How to pass arguments- \n
1. image_path == path to a graph image \n
2. x_range == [Value of left most point on graph's x-axis, Value of right most point on graph's x-axis]\n
3. y_range == [Value of bottom most point on graph's y-axis, Value of top most point on graph's y-axis]\n
4. background_value == 0 or 1 \n
   0: When the graph's background color is relatively darker than the curve\n
   1: Otherwise)  \n

Caution- Try to pass the Image by erasing the axes
