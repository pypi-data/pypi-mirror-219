class DockerStack(ContextableService):
    """
    Docker stack management class.

    You can use it in your tests or an automatic environment setup for your app.

    For more info about docker-compose see:

    https://docs.docker.com/compose/

    https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        with DockerStack(compose_files=['compose-file.yaml', 'compose-file-dev.yaml']) as stack:
            ...

    Async context is also provided (via threaded coroutines). All async functions use internal threading wrapped
    in coroutines.

    This class is made compatible with the service context manager class thus you may init it within
    the web app as a service to start the environment before the application itself (however it's not a very fast
    way to do it since it usually takes time to start and health check containers).

    .. note::

        If you are using Pycharm run configurations you may not be able to run docker because of crippled initialization
        of $PATH in some of docker installations. What you need to do is to echo $PATH from your terminal and copy
        them to the same variable inside your run configuration environment options.

    Recommendations:

    It's recommended to give a proper name to a stack and use profiles to manage services (see docker-compose
    profiles documentation). You should also try to inherit a base compose template in your compose files for different
    environments - this is done by using a list of compose files in arguments, the first file will be sequentially
    updated by other files. This is a standard docker-compose behaviour.
